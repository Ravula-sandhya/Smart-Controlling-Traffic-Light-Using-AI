Traffic congestion has become a major concern due to the rapid increase in vehicles and urbanization. Conventional traffic control systems operate on fixed timers, which fail to adapt to real-time road conditions, leading to longer waiting times, fuel wastage, and pollution. This project, Smart Control of Traffic Lights Using Artificial Intelligence, aims to overcome these challenges by using AI and image processing techniques. The system captures live images from traffic cameras and uses the YOLO object detection algorithm to calculate vehicle density at intersections. Based on this data, it dynamically adjusts the signal timings to optimize traffic flow. This approach reduces congestion, enhances road efficiency, and minimizes environmental impact. The framework is reliable, cost-effective, and can be implemented in smart city infrastructure to achieve intelligent and adaptive traffic management.
