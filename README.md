# Smart-Controlling-Traffic-Light-Using-AI
An AI-based traffic signal system that adjusts green light duration based on real-time vehicle density. Traffic video is processed using OpenCV and a YOLO model to detect and count vehicles in each lane, enabling dynamic signal timing instead of fixed intervals to reduce congestion.Technologies Used: Python, YOLO, OpenCV, NumPy
